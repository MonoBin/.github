## Description

MonoBin is a small, self-hosted pastebin where you can decide who gets to upload. Made using Kotlin, Angular and love. This project is still in development and is not ready for **any** use.

I just like making the README look nice to escape the actual work.

### What is the difference?

Using Keycloak, you can easily manage who gets to upload and who doesn't. This creates a semi-public pastebin where you can share your code with your friends or colleagues without worrying about random people uploading random stuff.
